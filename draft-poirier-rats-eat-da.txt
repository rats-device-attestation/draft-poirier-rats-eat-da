            An EAT Profile for Trustworthy Device Assignment
                    draft-poirier-rats-eat-da-latest

Abstract

   In confidential computing, device assignment (DA) is the method by
   which a device (e.g., network adapter, GPU), whether on-chip or
   behind a PCIe Root Port, is assigned to a Trusted Virtual Machine
   (TVM).  For the TVM to trust an assigned device, the device must
   provide the TVM with attestation Evidence confirming its identity and
   the state of its firmware and configuration.

   Since Evidence claims can be processed by 3rd party entities (e.g.,
   Verifiers, Relying Parties) external to the TVM, there is a need to
   standardize the representation of DA-related information in Evidence
   to ensure interoperability.  This document defines an attestation
   Evidence format for DA as an EAT (Entity Attestation Token) profile.

1.  Introduction

   In confidential computing, device assignment (DA) is the method by
   which a device (e.g., network adapter, GPU), whether on-chip or
   behind a PCIe Root Port, is assigned to a Trusted Virtual Machine
   (TVM).  Most confidential computing platforms (e.g., Arm CCA, AMD
   SEV-SNP, Intel TDX) provide DA capabilities.  Such capabilities
   prevent execution environments or software components that are
   untrusted by the TVM (including other TVMs and the host hypervisor)
   from accessing or controlling a device that has been assigned to the
   TVM.  This includes, for example, protection of device MMIO
   interfaces and device caches.  From a trust perspective, DA allows a
   device to be included in the TVM's Trusted Computing Base (TCB).  For
   the TVM to trust the device, the device must provide the TVM with
   attestation Evidence confirming its identity and the state of its
   firmware and configuration.

   This document defines an attestation Evidence format for DA as an EAT
   [RFC9711] profile.  The format is designed to be generic, extensible
   and architecture-agnostic.  Ongoing work on DA concentrates on PCIe
   devices that support the SPDM protocol [SPDM], but other bus
   architectures and protocols are expected to be supported as the
   technology gains wider adoption.  As such, this document focuses on
   the formalization of an Evidence format for SPDM-compliant devices
   while leaving room for the definition of other Evidence formats such
   as Compute Express Link (CXL) and the Coherent Hub Interface (CHI).
   This list is by no means exhaustive and is expected to expand.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Device Assignment Token (DAT) Claims

   The Device Assignment Token (DAT) is the encompassing envelope for
   the individual device claims to be presented.  A DAT can be used as a
   standalone entity but can also be embedded in a larger, platform-
   specific attestation token.  A DAT consists of an EAT profile
   identifier, a nonce and an EAT submodule (Section 4.2.18 of
   [RFC9711]) that contains any number of individual device claims.
   Each individual device claim is the combination of a device name and
   a standard claims format based on the bus or protocol the device
   supports.  The syntax of the device name depends on the type of bus
   or protocol used.  Each name consists of two parts joined by a
   semicolon: a namespace and a bus-specific name.  See Section 3.1.4
   for SPDM devices, and Section 3.2.1 for legacy PCIe devices.  As
   previously mentioned, this draft currently defines the claims set for
   SPDM compliant devices and PCIe legacy devices that do not support
   the SPDM protocol.  Careful condideration was also given to the
   overall design in order to leave room for future expansion.

     &(eat_profile: 265) => "tag:linaro.org,2025:device#1.0.0"
     &(eat_nonce: 10) => bytes .size 64 ; same as realm nonce
     &(eat_submods: 266) => {
       + device-name => $device-claims-set
     }
   }

   device-name = text .regexp "(legacy-pcie|spdm):.+"

   $device-claims-set /= spdm-claims
   $device-claims-set /= cxl-claims
   $device-claims-set /= chi-claims
   $device-claims-set /= pcie-legacy-claims

3.1.  SPDM Claims

   A SPDM claim instance is expected to be present for each SPDM
   compatible device to be attested.  Each instance consists of either a
   measurements section or a certificates section, or both.  Optionally,
   the Negotiated State preamble (version, capabilities and algorithms)
   bytes can be included to present the full negotiated state between
   the SPDM requester and responder.

   spdm-claims = {
     &(eat_profile: 265) => "tag:linaro.org,2025:device-spdm#1.0.0"
     spdm-artefacts
     ? &(vca: 3804) => bytes
   }

   spdm-artefacts //= (
     &(measurements: 3802) => spdm-measurements
     &(certificates: 3803) => spdm-certificates
   )

   spdm-artefacts //= (
     &(measurements: 3802) => spdm-measurements
   )

   spdm-artefacts //= (
     &(certificates: 3803) => spdm-certificates
   )

3.1.1.  Measurements Claim

   There can be up to 239 measurements per device with the entire
   measurement log optionally signed by the certificate populated in one
   of the 8 certificate slots.  It should be noted that measurements
   formalized herein follow the DMTF measurement specification.

   spdm-measurements = {
     + block-id => spdm-measurement
     ? "signature" => spdm-measurement-blocks-signature
   }

   block-id = 1..239

3.1.1.1.  Measurement

   SPDM measurements start with a component type that reflects one of
   the 10 categories defined by the SPDM specification.  Following is
   the measurement itself represented by either a raw bitstream or a
   digest.  The size of the digest value is derived from the measurement
   hash algorithm conveyed by the SPDM ALGORITHMS message response.

   spdm-measurement = {
     &(component-type: 1) => component-type
     measurement
   }

   measurement //= ( &(digest-measurement: 2) => digest-measurement )
   measurement //= ( &(raw-measurement: 3) => raw-measurement )

   component-type /= &(device-mode: 5)
   component-type /= &(mutable-firmware-version: 6)
   component-type /= &(mutable-firmware-svn: 7)
   component-type /= &(hash-extend-measurement: 8)
   component-type /= &(informational: 9)
   component-type /= &(structured-measurement-manifest: 10)

   raw-measurement = bytes
   digest-measurement = digest

   digest = [
     alg: uint / text
     val: bytes
   ]

3.1.1.2.  Measurements Signature

   SPDM compliant devices can optionally support the capability to sign
   measurements.  Included in the measurement claim signature are all
   the elements needed by a third party entity to reconstruct the
   original measurement log signed by the device.  Those elements
   include L1 (see CDDL below), the combined SPDM prefix, the hash
   algorithm used to generate a digest of the measurement log and nonces
   provided by the requester and responder.  The slot number of the leaf
   certificate used to sign the measurement log is also provided.

      &(slot: 1) => 0..7, ; Slot of the certificate chain used to

      &(base-hash-algo: 6) => hash-algorithm-type,
      &(signature: 7) => bytes
   }

3.1.2.  Certificate Claims

   According to the specification, SPDM compliant devices should support
   at most 8 slots, with slot 0 populated by default.  Slot 0 SHALL
   contain a certificate chain that follows the Device certificate model
   or the Alias certificate model.  Regardless of the certificate model
   used, a certificate chain comprises one or more DER-encoded X.509 v3
   certificates [RFC5280].  The certificates MUST be concatenated with
   no intermediate padding.

   spdm-certificates = {
     default-cert-slot => cert-chain
     ? aux-cert-slots => cert-chain
   }

   ; ASN.1 DER-encoded certificates concatenated with no intermediate
   ; padding.
   cert-chain = bytes

   default-cert-slot = 0
   aux-cert-slots = 1..7

3.1.3.  Negotiated State Preamble (Version, Capabilities and Algorithms)

   The Negotiated State Preamble (i.e., vca) claim contains the
   concatenation of messages GET_VERSION, VERSION, GET_CAPABILITIES,
   CAPABILITIES, NEGOTIATE_ALGORITHMS, and ALGORITHMS last exchanged
   between the SPDM Requester and Responder.

3.1.4.  Submodule Naming

   The namespace used for SPDM submodules is "spdm".

   The name associated with an SPDM submodule is extracted from the leaf
   certificate of the relevant device.

   *  If the leaf certificate contains a Subject Alternative Name of
      type DMTFOtherName, the submodule name is the value contained in
      ub-DMTF-device-info.  For example: "spdm:ACME:WIDGET:0123456789".

   *  Otherwise, the submod name is the string representation of the
      certificate Subject, as described in [RFC4514].  For example:
      "spdm:C=CA,O=ACME,OU=Widget,CN=0123456789".

3.2.  PCIe Legacy Device Claims

   The definition of a device claims set for PCIe legacy devices that do
   not implement the extensions needed to attest for their provenance
   and configuration is provided, making it is possible to keep using
   current assets as secures ones are being provisioned.  This legacy
   device claims set simply mirrors the type 0/1 common registers of the
   PCIe configuration space, mandating only that the vendor and device
   identification code be provided.  Other fields of the configuration
   space header may optionally be included should they add value.  A
   binary format of the PCIe configuration space is made available for
   processing by existing PCIe configuration space tools.  Implementers
   may optionally choose to include both text and binary versions should
   there be a use case to support this representation.

     ? &(headerType: 9) => bytes .size 1
     ? &(BITS: 10) => bytes .size 1
   }

3.2.1.  Submodule Naming

   The namespace used for legacy PCIe submodules is "legacy-pcie".

   The name is any arbitrary string chosen by the implementation.  For
   example, "legacy-pcie:0000:01:02.0" where "0000" is the domain, "01"
   the PCI bus id, "02" the device on the bus and "0" the device
   function.
